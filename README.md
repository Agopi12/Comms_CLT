# Comms_CLT

This project is about demonstrating CLT and how regardless of the underlying distribution, we get an approximately normal distribution with big enough sample size. The project does this by generating random realizations from a distribution through inverse cdf method. The realizations thus obtained are plotted as a histogram. 

The project uses a fair die and unfair die as an example to showcase the above.
